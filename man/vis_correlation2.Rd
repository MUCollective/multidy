\title{Participants responses in the study by Harrison et al., "Ranking Visualizations of correlation according to Weber's law"}
\format{
A data frame with 275,976 rows and 11 variables:
\describe{
  \item{rbase}{The coefficiant of correlation using which the stimuli was generated}
  \item{rv}{The actual coefficiant of correlationshown to participant}
  \item{approach}{Above or Below.  indicating that the reference value of r 
  was compared to values of r above it in the staircase procedure;
  or from below, indicated it was compared to values of r below it}
  \item{correctChoice}{L or R. What was the correct choice}
  \item{currentChoice}{L or R. What was the choice selected by participant}
  \item{gotItRight}{TRUE or FALSE. Whether the participant was correct or incorrect}
  \item{jnd}{Just Noticeable Difference value for the trial}
  \item{index}{Trial number within a block for each participant}
  \item{participant}{Participant identifier}
  \item{vis}{Type of visualization used}
  \item{rdirection}{The direction of the slope of the line (positive or negative)}
}
}
\description{
A dataset containing each individual responses of the participants.
In this study, participants were asked to make multiple judgements about the correlation in multiple blocks.
This dataset contains each judgement by each participant.
